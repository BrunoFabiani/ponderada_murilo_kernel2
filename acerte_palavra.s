buffer:   ; this is defining a block of my memory,
    db 20          ; db is "define byte", so im defining the byte here of the memory the BIOS is currently at as 20 (14h i think)

; "Many BIOS or DOS interrupts look specifically at AH to determine which function to perform."
; When you interupt the CPU there are different interupts number for different routines to call
; in this code i think the BIOS is checking the ah register and in hte different bloack of memorys and functions i made i put the subservice i want in ah  

datena:
    mov ah, 0x0E    ; sets teletype function
    int 0x10    ; chat "BIOS interrupt runs the function, printing the character in AL at the current cursor position."
    ret ; returns controll to the kernel or BIOS?

fausto_silva:
    lodsb     ; load string, more exactly load byte at address, DS:SI, into AL, then increment SI by 1 moving the register to the next memory location
    cmp al, 0  ; its a subtraction, cmp is compare (i think) so its comapring what is in al to 0, and if its 0 it sets zt to 0. --> chat(cmp X, Y is basically X - Y without storing the result) it updates several flags when you do that, the flag that murilo needed to check was zf, zero flag, and in the next line we check, using jz, if zf = 1 wich means that this cmp resulted in zero and it doesnt have any word that this is reading cool
    jz .done   ; jz is a conditional jump instruction in x86 assembly, so this is teeling jump if zero to .done, since in previous  wow so cool murilo things make sense if you actually try to understand them your a good professor if your still reading this im surprised that you actually decided to look at my code 
    call datena  ; since we loaded the byte into AL (8 bit right?), we call datena in wich he sets the teletype function and tells the BIOS to print the characters in al at the current cursor position

    mov cx, 20             ; cx is a assmebly that defines the max lenght or something like that, chat = "CX is the runtime loop counter", actually its just the BIOS convention for that register, some operations (like cmpsb) use specific register do they become the conventional use for those things, in this case its the counter register 
    mov byte [buffer+1], 0 ; just sets to 0 the second byte of the block of memory i called buffer

                ; mov stands for move but it functionallys copies a value into a register or memory location, so saying mov ax, bx its telling to copy the value in ax and copy it to bx, mov destination, source
